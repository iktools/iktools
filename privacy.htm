    <h1>IK Tools Privacy Policy</h1>
    IK Tools and our products do not collect user data on our own, however, some data is collected by advertisement services.
    <h2>Google Mobile Ads Privacy Policy</h2>
    Google may use the advertising ID from the device on which the ad is serving to generate interests and demographics (for example, 'sports enthusiasts'). Interests, demographics, and other data may be used to serve better targeted ads to the user. Additionally, your app's privacy policy may need to be updated to reflect the use of personalized advertising (formerly known as interest-based advertising) served via the Google Mobile Ads SDK. Please take a moment to review your app's privacy policies and ensure that they are up-to-date. Because publisher pages and laws vary across countries, we're unable to suggest specific privacy policy language.</br>
</br>
To complement personalized advertising (formerly known as interest-based advertising), <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Ads Settings</a> lets users view and edit their interests and demographics. Some users may choose to opt out of personalized ads.
